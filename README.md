# Estates auth
This service is a facade in front of auth and agent-access-control, it is responsible for authenticating users who want to register and maintain an estate.


---

To run tests on this service use the test script:

```
./run_all_tests.sh
```

---

To run locally using the microservice provided by the service manager:

```
sm2 --start ESTATES_ALL
```

---

If you want to run your local copy, then stop the frontend ran by the service manager and run your local code by using the following (port number is 8836 but is defaulted to that in build.sbt).

`sbt run`
